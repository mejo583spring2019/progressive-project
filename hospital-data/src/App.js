      <h2>In January 2019, a law went into effect requiring
       hospitals in the United States to make procedure pricing
       available online. </h2>
      <p>Lawmakers enacted the <a className="moreinfo" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6508/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hospital Price Transparency and Disclosure Act of 2018</a> with the goal of ensuring price transparency for hospital patients. However, many currently available resources <a className="moreinfo" href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/07/health/hospital-prices-online-partner/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fail</a> to present information in an effective or user-friendly manner. Prices hide deep within hospital sites, use vague codes and medical jargon, and provide only spreadsheets readable by machine rather than information easily understood by the human eye. Furthermore, prices between hospitals for identical procedures may vary immensely, causing some patients to pay significantly more at some hospitals than at others.</p>
      <h4>Price transparency starts here.</h4>
      <p>We believe that patients deserve to understand the
        cost of procedures, to know how costs between hospitals
        differ and to choose the hospital that will best suit
        their needs without surprise charges. Our tool helps
        patients take control over their health and finances.</p><p>Use
the navigation bar to the left to explore and
        compare prices between three hospitals in the Triangle area.</p>
