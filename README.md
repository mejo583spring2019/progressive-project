# MEJO 583 Spring'19 Progressive Project

Comparing Hospital Data: In this project, I parsed hospital data over three top hospitals in the triangle to show the differences in cost. 

#Data Prep & Cleaning 

Data was obtained from the websites for the following hospitals: 
- Duke University Hospital
- WakeMed Hospital 
- UNC Medical Center

#Prep 

Data was manually cleaned to be in CSV format with headers. 

Additionally, data was parsed to populate columns as needed to create consistently formatted data using Tabulator.


# Resources

Data files and additional resources were available via class pages as well as video lecture notes.
